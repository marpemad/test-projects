# test-projects

Those are my projects that are completed within a single IPython notebook, and don't warrant an entire repository.
## Highlights
- My very first project: [Risk Dice Simulator](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/test-projects/blob/master/riskdicesimulator.py)
- [Machine Learning Algorithms Crash Course](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/test-projects/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms%20Crash%20Course.ipynb)
- [Predicting Electric Vehicle Rotor Temperature](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/test-projects/blob/master/Predicting%20Electric%20Vehicle%20Rotor%20Temperature.ipynb)
